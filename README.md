What is Bussycoin?
----------------

Shown are the two sides of the coin, Mr. B and that one meme cat wearing a gnome child hat.

*Final coin pending approval for Mr B. usage*

*Final coin also waiting on an artist to redisgn the gnome cat*

Coin might also be redisgned by a professional if I feel like it

**Bussycoin is a lite version of litecoin which is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.**
 - 6.9 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 69,000 blocks (God knows when and if Bussy will ever hit this)
 - ~69,696,969 million total coins (KEKW)
 - 69 coins per block
 - who knows how many blocks ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  to retarget difficulty

Bussycoin was created by a idiotic twitch chatter after discussing the concept of bussycoin with 2 other chat members (danmoyer and vexcellent) during a Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury stream hosted by TheGameDame (https://www.twitch.tv/thegamedame). Bussycoin is developed and maintained by Runescape Life. This currency is a meme and is more or less designed for people to have fun while exploring blockchain and crypto with little to no risk (at the moment, and this is not finnacial advice. I'm not a financial advisor losers).

**Bussycoin goals for the future.**
 - Update wallet UI and release windows binaries
 - Get some hardening done yo
 - Get some nodes in the cloud homies
 - Find a coin exchange that will accept us


**Other useless information about the coin.**
 - shits made in c++ yo
 - literally copied from litecoin pending some changes to the source code
 - no I don't know c++... I'm a Infrastructure engineer that works with cloud and python git off my back
 - yes my art skills are lacking
 - more useless than dogecoin

Another litecoin/bitcoin clone?
-------------------------------
Yes I know, everyone and their mother now has their own altcoin. It's so easy that I did it stumbling my way through a command line and c++ files changing random variables and fixing errors by adjusting exception handlers to prevent them from throwing an error. 

You might be asking, what makes this coin so different from all the others? Absolutely nothing. This is just a meme like all cryptocurrency if we are being honest. I have no interest in having an ICO, finding an exchange to list bussycoin, or even maintaining the damn thing. Bussycoin is just here to have fun and liven up communities. Our goal is just to offer bussycoins as a fun little side thing for people to trade with between friends or have friendly wagers with. No ulterior motives, no secret goals, no chinese spyware, and no crypto elitism or gatekeeping. Afterall I have three braincells, four of which are busy playing runescape, so its not like I have the mental capacity to plan world domination with an imaginary coin.
